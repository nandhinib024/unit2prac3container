        <p class="text-right; border border-dark  p-3">What we call freesias are actually cultivated hybrids of a number 
            of flowers in the Freesia family, and that’s why we refer to them as their scientific name. 
            Unlike many of the other entries in this list, these beautiful trumpet-like blooms 
            aren’t named after something in Latin or Greek, but take their name from botanist and 
            doctor Friedrich Freese.</p><br>
